# MNIST-Hand-Written-Digit-Classification
Choosing any two digits e.g. 0 and 5 and using KNN, Gaussian NB and Random Forest Machine Learning Technique models to classify these two digits. 

I am using K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine and Gussian NB to learn from MNIST Hand Written data set and then apply this learning to classify digits- 0 and 5 using different models.
